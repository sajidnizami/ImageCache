UIImageView * is the reference of where the image needs to be set\
Duration is defined in the following manner: 
  Keep: Stores the images in the Library and when application is backed up by phone all the images are backed up too.
  OneWeek: Stores images in the tmp/OneWeek folder 
  OneMonth: Stores images in the tmp/OneMonth folder
  Temp: Stores images in the tmp folder.
